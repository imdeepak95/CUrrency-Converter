# Currency-Converter
This a basic Currency Converter application created by using Java swing and Apache NetBeans 15 IDE is used.
<br>
Design
<br>
We have the GUI as output with 2 labels, 1 text-fields, and 1 buttons
<br>
Initially, the text-field is empty
<br>
The user can then enter a numerical value to be converted from Indian Rupee to a particular foreign currency mentioned on the buttons on the left panel.
<br>
Similarly, the user can convert the value entered in the upper text-field from a particular foreign currency to its equivalent Indian rupee value.
<br>
Respective conversions are displayed in new popup.
<br>
The Close button then can be used to close the application.
